WIP tactics game (in the spirit of Fire Emblem), using XNA/Monogame. Not yet playable, but there is some code to speak of! Currently implemented features:

- Multi-layer tile rendering engine which accepts output from the [Tiled Map Editor](http://www.mapeditor.org)
- Unit pathfinding based on tile passability flags set by map editor
- Unit selection and movement UI (with the little range flower overlay)
- Turn ending mechanics
